# Pronoun Practice
A browser extension to help people practice unfamiliar pronoun sets.

People with non-binary gender identities are becoming more common.
Maybe a friend or a member of your family has recently told you that
they would prefer to be called "they," and no matter how much you want to support them, using "they" as a singular pronoun feels uncomfortable to you.  Maybe you, like me, have been on the other side
of that exchange.  Now you can practice (or help someone else practice)
by automatically replacing gendered pronouns with the equivalent non-gendered one.

## To set up
1. pull down the repo
1. in a browser, navigate to [about:debugging](about:debugging)
1. click "Load Temporary Add-on"
1. select any file in the pronoun_practice directory
1. navigate to a Wikipedia page

## To run tests
Just open SpecRunner.html.  See [the Jasmine docs](https://jasmine.github.io/) for more info.

## Todos:
* run on all pages, not just Wikipedia
* create an icon
* update verbs
* [add more pronoun sets](https://my.pronoun.is/)
* allow users to select which set to use
* allow users to replace the two sets of gendered pronouns with different neutral sets
* publish this in the Chrome and Firefox browser extension places so
  peeps can actually use it
